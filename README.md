# WATExR

The WATExR project aims to deliver a series of environmental and ecological seasonal forecasting tools to 
the water sector within a user-friendly software environment (e.g., QGIS). The tools will employ a variety
of under-the-hood lake, catchment and fish phenology models to provide stakeholders 
(e.g., reservoir managers/educators/fish stock assessors) with predictions of aquatic phenomena at a 
seasonal time-scale. Using the tools, stakeholders will have access to probabilistic aquatic forecasts 
driven by state-of-the-art seasonal climate projections. The tools will update monthly
and provide an indication of the expected average environmental conditions during the impending 3 to 9 months
relative to the average conditions experienced during the most recent climate period. In so doing, the water
sector will join the growing list of environmental sectors for which seasonal climate forecasts are showing
strong potential to inform management; e.g., mitigating fire risk in Mediterranean shrubland (Bedia et al., 2018),
and reducing southern blue-fin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) by-catch in the Southern Ocean (Hobday et al., 2011). By: A. S. French, E. de Eyto
